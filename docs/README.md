## Introduction

(Insert stuff here)

## Uses

## [Dependencies](DEPENDENCIES.md)

### Install

Double click `dependencies`, or run `bash dependencies` or `./dependencies` in the root directory or to install the python dependencies. All the c++ dependencies are included in `source/C++` already. You must have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installed to download the new dependencies. Also, you'll need to install python yourself if you haven't already.
