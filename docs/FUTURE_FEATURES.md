# Future features

- [ ] In the near future, I want to add the [A* Pathfinding Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) to the program. This would allow the user to find the shortest path from one article to another through the wikipedia links.
- [ ] I also want do do something with [Strongly Connected Components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component) in the graph, but I just thought of this, so I don't know how I'd implement it yet. If you have any ideas, please let me know in the [suggestions](https://github.com/Huckdirks/Wikipedia_Links_Graph/discussions/new?category=suggestions)!
- [ ] I also want to add some visualizations to the program, so the user can see the graph and the pathfinding algorithm in action, but I honestly know nothing about graphics programming, so that might not happen. If you know anything about graphics programming, please consider contributing or sending some advice/knowledge my way!

### If you have any good ideas for new features, please create a [new discussion in ideas](https://github.com/Huckdirks/Wikipedia_Graph/discussions/new?category=ideas), or if you've coded it already make a pull request! I'd love to hear your ideas!
If you need any help figuring out the code in order to add any features, visit the [wiki](https://github.com/Huckdirks/Wikipedia_Graph/wiki) for more information. If you still need help, create a [new discussion in help](https://github.com/Huckdirks/Wikipedia_Graph/discussions/new?category=help).
