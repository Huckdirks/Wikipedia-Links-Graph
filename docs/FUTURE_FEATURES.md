# Future features

- In the near future, I want to add the [A* pathfinding algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) to the program. This would allow the user to find the shortest path from one article to another through the wikipedia links.
- I also want to add some visualizations to the program, so the user can see the graph and the pathfinding algorithm in action, but I honestly know nothing about graphics programming, so that might not happen.
